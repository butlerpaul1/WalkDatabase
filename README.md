This project will allow a user to view various walks and all the information associated with that walk, 
such as distance of the walk itself, distance to the walk from your current location, type of terrain, 
live weather updates for the walk location and a tab containing the most recent images uploaded to Instagram of the walk.

It will allow users to create their own account, giving them access to marking walks as complete and/or favouriting them for future use.
This will allow the application to develop an understanding of what the user looks for in outdoor walks,
and based on this the app will suggest walks for the user.
